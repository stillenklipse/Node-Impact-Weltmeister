Node-Impact-Weltmeister
=======================

Greatly inspired and updated from these repos:

https://github.com/namuol/node-impact-weltmeister
https://github.com/drhayes/impact-dev-server


I wanted a simple way to run Weltmeister for impact without having to set up PHP and stuff.  I went with this Node set up since Impact is JS and would be able to easily work in multiple file locations and projects at the same time.

Simple Installation:

- Install Node
- Install required libraries
- Copy the builder.js and node folder into the root directoty of your Impact Project
- Navigate that folder in Terminal type "node builder.js"
- The server will run on port 5000




To Be Updated:
- List out dependecies.
- Update to use less dependencies.
